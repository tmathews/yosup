# Yo Sup

[Issue Tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~tomtom/damus-web-issues)

"Yo Sup" is a minimal Nostr client that grew out of the original Damus Web
code. It's goal is to view your feed and access your direct messages very fast.
So fast it works over 3G with a fresh page load. It has no goals to fulfill any
other NIPs, please use other clients such as Snort, Coracle, or Iris.

It's written in plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for ease of development and
building. Small features and optimizations will be added as needed, but the
application is considered "complete".

Patches are welcomed via email.
